Plan to develop an mobile app to facilitate close-range communication in places with minimal internet connectivity or no mobile signal.
Communication among rescue teams and victims is often a significant hurdle in rescue operations. We can develop an application for smartphones (assuming significant number of people have smartphone) so that it can automatically detect and notify if some device is in range (Bluetooth or WiFi or Internet). Then it can automatically add the member to some sort of group chat.
