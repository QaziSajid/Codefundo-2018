Plan to develop an mobile app to facilitate close-range communication in places with minimal internet connectivity.
Communication among rescue teams and victims is often a significant hurdle in rescue operations. We can develop an application for smartphones (assuming significant number of people have smartphone) so that it can automatically detect and notify if some device is in range (by using Latitude and Location). Then it can automatically add the member to a group chat.
On starting the app, the user can see the group chat of their area. After signing in, they can also post messages. All messages are accompanied by sender's location, so that they can be located by rescue groups.
